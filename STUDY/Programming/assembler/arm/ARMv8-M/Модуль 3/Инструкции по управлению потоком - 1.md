## Branch Instructions


> [!new] 
> Branch instruction have the following format:
> `B{<cond>} label`
> Branch range depends on instruction set and width

```asm
	B start ; perfom PC-relative branch to label 'start'
	MOVS r0, r1

lab1
	ADDS r0, #1
	..
	..
start ; continue exec from here
	CMP r0, r1 
	..
```

PC = Program counting

## Subroutines: Branch with link

> [!new] 
> Implementing a conventional subroutine call requires two steps:
> - Store the return address
> - Branch to the address of the required subroutine

> [!fact] 
> These steps are carried out in one instruction, ***BL***
> - The return address is stored in link register (r14/lr)
> - Branch to an address 

> [!hint] 
> Returning is performed by restoring the program counter (pc) from lr
