## Accessing special-purpose registers


> [!fact] 
> The MRS/MSR instructions can be used to access special-purpose registers
> `MRS Rd, <reg>`  - Moves from special-purpose registers to Rd
> `MSR <reg>, Rm` - Moves from Rm to special-purpose registers
> 

> [!important] 
> Its able to access all internal registers:
> - Stack Pointers (MSP, PSP) (Main stack pointer, Proccess stack pointer)
> - Status Registers (IPSR, EPSR, APSR, IEPSR, IAPSR, EAPSR, PSR) ()
> - Interrupt Registers (PRIMASK, BASEPRI, BASEPRI_MAX, FAULTMASK)
> - CONTROL register


> [!caution] 
> Rules and Restrictions:
> - Thread mode cannot read alternate stack pointer or IPSR - zeros will be returned
> - All EPSR bits read as zero during normal exec but can be read when in halting debug mode
> - The APSR can be written to by software in Handler or Thread Mode
> - Software is not permitted to write to the IPSR or EPSR
> - BASEPRI_MAX option updates the BASEPRI mask register only when the new value increases the priority level


## Power Managment Instructions


> [!new] 
> Wait For Interrupt - **`WFI`**
> - Puts the core into standby mode
> - Woken by an interrupt or debug event

> [!example] 
> `__WFI();`
> `WFI`

> [!new] 
> Wair For Event - **`WFE`**
> - Same as `WFI`, but will also wake the core on a signalled event

> [!example] 
> `__WFE();`
> `WFE`

> [!new] 
> Send Event - **`SEV`**
> - Signals an event to other cores in a multi-processor system

> [!example] 
> `__SEV();`
> `SEV`

## No operation (LOL)

> [!new] 
> No operation - **`NOP`**
> - like pass
> - may or may not take time to exec

> [!example] 
> `__NOP();`
> `NOP`
